# Independent Study - Transcriptomic Analysis of Myxococcus Xanthus 

This is an R-based transcriptomic analysis project developed as part of a senior undergraduate thesis investigating energy and phosphate homeostasis in Myxococcus xanthus. This work focuses on understanding the combined and independent roles of Arginine Kinase (AK) and Polyphosphate Kinase 1 (Ppk1) in regulating bacterial metabolism, development, and global gene expression. Using RNA-seq data collected across multiple strains and conditions, including wild type, ΔAK, ΔPpk1 (ΔAR), and revertant backgrounds, this project aims to characterize transcriptional disruption and rescue patterns associated with altered energy buffering systems.

The repository contains a complete and reproducible RNA-seq analysis workflow implemented in R, leveraging packages such as DESeq2, dplyr, ggplot2, and tidyverse for data processing, differential expression analysis, and visualization. In addition to standard differential expression pipelines, this project introduces a custom rescue-classification framework to quantify the extent to which ΔAR strains recover gene expression disrupted in ΔAK backgrounds. Results are summarized through PCA, volcano plots, heatmaps, and gene-set–level comparisons to link transcriptional changes with known developmental gene clusters and metabolic pathways.
